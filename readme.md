# Aerotool - Aircraft maintanance manuals, materials and tool management software

## Description

The Aerotool project emerged from the interest of students currently in the final year of the Technical Course in Internet Computing (TII) integrated with High School, under the guidance of the Professor Jorge Francisco Cutigi and Professor Lucas Bueno R. de Oliveira. It consists of a tool request management system for didactic purposes, where teachers request tool loans through requests to the responsible technician, who approves or denies them. The system promotes greater traceability of the tools and prevents losses or theft of items. Currently, the tool module is in the process of development. In addition to these, future updates are planned to implement Aircraft Management and Warehouse Control modules.

## Target Audience
